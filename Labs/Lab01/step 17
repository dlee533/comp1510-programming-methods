     Step 17. which of the following assignments are valid?4

     x = 1 : this is the only valid assignment statement as a variable is assigned to an integer 1
     x = y : by itself, it is invalid. 'y' has not been assigned any value
     x = y + 2 : again, it is invalid for the same reason as above
     x + 1 = 3 : it is a math equation
     x + y = y + x : same as above
